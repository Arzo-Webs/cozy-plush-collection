      <p>
        Cozy Plush Boutique is a product catalog application built with React.
        It allows users to browse a collection of plush toys and view detailed
        information for each product.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project was created as a React Router assignment to demonstrate
        multi-page navigation, nested routes using Outlet, dynamic routes with
        useParams, and programmatic navigation with useNavigate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application focuses on frontend structure and routing concepts
        rather than full e-commerce functionality.
